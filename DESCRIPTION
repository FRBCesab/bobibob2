Description: Allows exploration of the diversity and global 
    distribution of all Kelp species, Laminaricaeae (those available 
    in GBIF, Global Biodiversity Information Faciltity; https://www.gbif.org).
    Data is extracted directly from GBIF, determined by the desired taxa 
    parameters - i.e. Laminaricaeae. The taxonomic structure is visualised 
    as a network. Each node in the taxonomy network links to an html displaying 
    a range of interactive figures, summarising occurance of the species of 
    interest in time and space. For details on how to adapt this dashboard, 
    including downloading desired taxa data see github.
